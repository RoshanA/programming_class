<img src="../images/nec.jpg" alt="necronomicon" align=right height ="220" width ="300">

<br>

<p>

			Description from Amazon: The Necronomicon has been found to contain formula for spiritual trans-formation, consistent with some of the most ancient mystical processes in the world, processes that were not public knowledge when the book was first published, processes that involve communion with the stars.

			In spite of all the controversy, the first edition sold out before it was published. And it has never been out of print since then. This year, the original designer of the 1977 edition and the original editor have joined forces to present a new, deluxe hardcover edition of the most feared, most reviled, and most desired occult book on the planet.

				Description from Amazon: This 2007 book is the result of discussion and consultation lasting 20 years and involving hundreds of geoscientists worldwide. It presents a complete nomenclature of metamorphic rocks, with a comprehensive glossary of definitions, sources and etymology of over 1200 terms, and a list of mineral abbreviations. Twelve multi-authored sections explain how to derive the correct names for metamorphic rocks and processes, and discuss the rationale behind the more important terms. These sections deal with rocks from high- to low- and very-low-grade. This book will form a key reference and international standard for all geoscientists studying metamorphic rocks.
